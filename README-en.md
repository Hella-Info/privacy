## Which data is collected?

The following kinds of data are collected by your ONYX® system and are
transmitted to our servers to help us to improve our products:

  - Serial numbers of ONYX® components
  - Measurements and settings of ONYX® components such as weather data and motor
    parameters
  - Quality of the radio transmission between ONYX® components
  - Version numbers of hardware and software components
  - Error messages and crash logs
  - Type and version of the devices, such as mobile phones and tablets, that are
    connected to your ONYX® system

All data is anonymized. Analyzing an individual users behaviour and/or the
creation of user profiles is not possible with the data we collect. 

## Why does the ONYX® app need access to my location?

When configuring your ONYX® system, the ONYX® app asks you for the exact location
of your ONYX.CENTER. This is necessary to correctly calculate the times of
sunrise and sunset. Exact location data is only stored on your ONYX.CENTER and
on your personal devices. It is not transmitted to our servers.
