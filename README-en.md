# Privacy policy

Our application can be generally used without providing personal data. The use
of individual services from our site may be governed by differing regulations;
these cases are explained separately below. Your personal data (e.g., name,
address, email address, telephone number, etc.) will be processed by us
exclusively in accordance with Austrian data protection laws. Data are thus
considered personal if they can be clearly assigned to an individual, physical
person. The legal basis for data protection can be found in the Austrian
[Data Protection Law 2000](https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597).
The following regulations inform you about the nature and scope of the personal
data we collect, process, and use, and for what purpose.

Please note that Internet-based data transmission presents security gaps and
that complete protection against access by third parties is impossible.

## Data storage

The type of personal data that we collect depends on the collection method.
Through the website and the app, we can capture:

  - IP address
  - MAC address
  - User ID
  - Geographical location
  - Types of devices connected to the ONYX app
  - Usage data
  - Crash data

We also store these usage data to provide you with appropriate customer service
and post-purchase troubleshooting. Usage data shall be stored as long as
necessary to offer you our services. ONYX transmits data using secure methods
(via SSL) and encrypts some data when they are stored. We retain data as long as
it is necessary to provide the services.

## Information/revocation/deletion

If you have any questions regarding the collection, processing, or use of your
personal information, or to request that your data be disclosed, corrected,
blocked, or deleted, or to revoke consent, please contact us. You also have a
right to correct inaccurate data, delete, or block your personal data insofar as
it is not required for fulfilling a contract, and deletion is not contrary to
any legal obligation of retention.
